However there is a bit of work here that can be automated to make adding paths easier.\n\nThats where paths comes in; itâ€™s a simple script written in nodejs that exposes the path to nodejs and as a simple CLI.\n\nInstall via npm\n\n\tnpm install paths -g\n\nWant to see your $PATH in a more human readable format? Run the following in terminal\n\n\tpaths\n\nThis will return something like this:\n\n\tPATHS\n\t/foo\n\t/opt/local/bin\n\t/opt/local/sbin\n\t/usr/bin\n\t/bin\n\t/usr/sbin\n\t/sbin\n\t/usr/local/bin\n\t/usr/X11/bin\n\nIf you want to add a path to your ~/.profile\n\n\tpaths add /foo",
